Have been going along with several ML projects recently, I found out this skeleton was the most convenient for me, respect to the most struggling requirement: Less dependent as much as possible on platform it is running. 

I just need to make tiny modification and then, could easily run training/inference/debugging on my physical laptop, server with/without GPU support, or google colab.
